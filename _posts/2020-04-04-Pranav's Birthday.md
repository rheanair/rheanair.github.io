Wherever life leads you
What’s here today is a poem for you!

Congrats! The years have passed by so fast
But at the end of the day everyone had a blast!

 Your Birthday may seem like your old ending 
With a new world opening, another beginning 

This is a joyful and happy day
You are off to places up and away!

Pranav, you are a big brother to me
Someone I can look up to and see
What you have taught me to be!

You’ll have obstacles no doubt
But we will all help you to find a different route!

With you there is always a smile on our face.
When we need support, you're there right at the right place!

Your passion for cars in an incredible race
We will cheer on you all the way to space!

These fancy balloons and accomplishments all for you
To celebrate all the hard work you do!

All the fun you have brought down
I will remember every year round!
