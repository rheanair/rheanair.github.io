Hold on to dreams, never let go
They can be fast even when you want to go slow!

Tighten your grip before they fly away
Close your eyes in bed and lay!

Relax and rest from your tiring day
The window reflects the sun's beautiful ray!

Trees swaying outside the backyard  
Write out your feelings in a memorable card!

Think, Think, Think is what dreaming is about
Hold on to those fast, who means a lot!
